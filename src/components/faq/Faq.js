        <h3>3. WHEN IS THE APPLICATION DEADLINE?</h3>
        <p>
          Usually, the application deadline is 5 to 6 months prior to the day
          you want to go for an internship. If you give more time to processing
          your application, there is a highly likely chance of getting a better
          hotel/ resort for the internship.

          Generally, you need to speak the English language. If you know any
